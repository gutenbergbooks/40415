  BROWN, TAGGARD & CHASE.
  1857.

ANNA E. TOWER,

In the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the District of
Massachusetts.

ELECTROTYPED AT THE
BOSTON STEREOTYPE FOUNDRY.




PREFACE.


Teachers will observe that only a FEW LETTERS _at a time_ are given to
the pupil, and with them _words_ formed of those _few letters_. Thus
the alphabet as presented to a child in detached portions, and each
successive portion practically used in _words_ before the next is
learned.

This method is claimed as a peculiar feature of this book, except so
far as it is used in the "GRADUAL PRIMER."

The alphabets at the beginning of the book are for those who prefer to
teach in the old way, and for all to learn the old order of
arrangement.

No word is used in the book till it has first been given to the pupil
in a spelling lesson.

This book will be an easy introduction to the "GRADUAL PRIMER," the
First Reader of Tower's Series; also to his "PICTORIAL PRIMER;" and, in
short, to _any_ Series of readers.

It is especially designed for the LOWEST CLASS in the primary schools,
to encourage children by making their first step simple, easy,
attractive, and interesting.

JANUARY, 1857.
